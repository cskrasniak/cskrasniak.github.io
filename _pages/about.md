I'm a neuroscientist-turned-data scientist excited about exploring data to answer interesting questions and solve problems.

Experience
======

-Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory – Graduate researcher

-[International Brain Laboratory](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/] – Researcher				            

-Colby College Research Methods and Statistics in Psychology TA


Recent Projects
======
 
Cortex-wide neural imaging in behaving mice
----
- Found that neural information predictive of behavior is both distributed throughout the brain, but specifically localized at different times
- Collected 100Tb of imaging data
- Implemented automated preprocessing and data transfer (batch script executing python and MATLAB scripts)
- Created multi-stage analytic pipeline (PCA, custom curve fitting, feature engineering, cross-validated logistic regression, Bernoulli testing, permutation testing) to create publication-ready figures (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Presented at International Brain Lab Annual Meeting with manuscript in preparation
- [Code here](https://github.com/cskrasniak/wfield/tree/master/notebooks)
- Insert image here

Inhibition scan of cortex
----
- Found different roles of visual cortex and secondary motor cortex in the standard drift-diffusion model
- Integrated 2d laser scanning (MATLAB) with existing custom behavioral task code (Python) [code here](https://github.com/cskrasniak/lesion_project/tree/master/GalvoScanning)
- Fit behavior to a psychometric function using maximum likelihood optimization [code here](https://github.com/cskrasniak/lesion_project/blob/master/thesis_scan_analysis)
- Created a drift-diffusion model simulation to compare behavioral results to the model
- Image here

Ongoing work -> predicting income from an AirBnB listing
----
- Compiled listing data from [insideAirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/) with Selenium
- Cleaned data with pandas [code here](https://github.com/cskrasniak/rentals)
- Plan to use this data to create a dashboard for determining how much you could earn by listing a property
