I'm a data  with a background in neuroscience excited about exploring data to answer interesting questions and solve business problems. I'm especially interested in Biotech and tech, but I can get excited about almost any challenging field.

Experience
======
- The Data Incubator — Data Science Fellow
- Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory – Graduate researcher
- [International Brain Laboratory](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/) – Researcher				            
- Colby College Research Methods and Statistics in Psychology TA


Recent Projects
======
 
Ongoing work -> Web app for optimized income from short-term rentals
----
- scraped ~500k AirBnB listings from 30 cities 
- created preprocessing pipeline to seamlessly filter and clean data
- trained XGBoost model to predict occupancy rates for each listing using all availbale data, including NLP of text fields and feature engineering of location, price, etc.
- creating webapp to take user input and predict monthly earnings for the details of a user's listing
- [Code here](https://github.com/cskrasniak/rentals)


Cortex-wide neural imaging in behaving mice
----
- Found that neural information predictive of behavior is both distributed throughout the brain, but specifically localized at different times
- Collected 100Tb of imaging data
- Implemented automated preprocessing and data transfer (batch script executing python and MATLAB scripts)
- Created multi-stage analytic pipeline (PCA, custom curve fitting, feature engineering, cross-validated logistic regression, Bernoulli testing, permutation testing) to create publication-ready figures (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Presented at International Brain Lab Annual Meeting with manuscript in preparation
- [Code here](https://github.com/cskrasniak/wfield/tree/master/notebooks)
- Insert image here

Inhibition scan of cortex
----
- Found different roles of visual cortex and secondary motor cortex in the standard drift-diffusion model
- Integrated 2d laser scanning (MATLAB) with existing custom behavioral task code (Python) [code here](https://github.com/cskrasniak/lesion_project/tree/master/GalvoScanning)
- Fit behavior to a psychometric function using maximum likelihood optimization [code here](https://github.com/cskrasniak/lesion_project/blob/master/thesis_scan_analysis)
- Created a drift-diffusion model simulation to compare behavioral results to the model
- Image here
