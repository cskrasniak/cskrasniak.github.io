This figure shows the error in probe insertions across the mouse brain of all the recordings I performed for the International Brain Laboratory. I wanted to assess the error in my ability to target a given location, how it changed over time, and if there were any systematic errors. To do this I plotted the vector from the intended coordinates of my insertions to the actual coordinates recovered from histology on a partial map of the dorsal mouse brain. From the top right plot you can see there was an overall decrease in both the variance and error in my targeting, and I eventually reached the standard accepted minimum error of 300um. From the inset polar plot, you can also see that there seems to be some reproducible bias in which direction the errors were in. To further investigate this bias, I then plotted the insertions of individual animals, and saw that within animals there was often a consistent direction of error. This indicated that the skull landmarks that I estimated to zero the position of the probe were likely shifted from the location of this landmark in our reference atlas, creating a bias that was consistent within each animal. This consistent bias was an easy source of error to solve, which was corrected for the last two animals shown (CSH_ZAD_029 and CSH_ZAD_025) which led to the improved performance in targeting seen in the rightmost section of the scatter plot.
